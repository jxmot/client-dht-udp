# client-dht-udp
The web client to the node-dht-udp server, displays temperature and humidity using gauges.

## Status

Decided that Google Gauges is the best choice for displaying gauges at this time. The other I tried were cumbersome and bug-ridden. In addition their documentation was also lacking.
